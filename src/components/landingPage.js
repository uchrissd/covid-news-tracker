              The coronavirus pandemic has spread rapidly across California.
              Experts say the true number of people infected is unknown and
              likely much higher than official tallies.

              To better understand the spread of the virus, The Times is
              conducting an independent, continual survey of dozens of local
              health agencies across the state. So far today, six of the 61
              agencies weâ€™re monitoring have reported new numbers.
